# Neuropixels Auditory Responses
Lab Rotation Project performing Statistical Analysis on the responses of single and multi-units to auditory stimuli using Neuropixels 1.0 probe data, preprocessed with CatGT software (SpikeGLX feature).

## MATLAB codes.
 - find_Clusters_Evoked_Response : Get the spike times, clusters (single-units), and triggers, finding suitable clusters and plotting their frequency tuning, as long as the evoked responses for 8-tones trials in repeat.
 - plot_Tuning_Curves : Get the spike times, clusters and triggers. Plot clusters' tuning curves to different stimuli.
 - view_Histogram_Dephts : Get the spike times, clusters and triggers. PLotting drift map of the selected sequence, and compute histograms with the number of spikes that are contained within the specified depths.
 - visualize_Plots : Get the spike times, clusters and triggers. Choose a cluster and plot the raster plot of the spikes per trial.
