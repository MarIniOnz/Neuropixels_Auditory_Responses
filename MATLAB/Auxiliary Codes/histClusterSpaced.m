%
% Function that represents a histogram with all the spikes accuring in a 
% in a specified block of a sequence, along with the triggers as vertical
% lines.
%
% Inputs
%     spTimes: cell, with the vectors of the # trials containing the times 
%     of the spikes per trial.
%     spSites: cell, with the vectors of the # trials containing the
%     IDs of the clusters to which the spikes belong.
%     cl_idx: num, cluster ID.
%     n_bins: num, number of bins for the histogram.
%     recParams: struct, extracted from function recDataForSubject.
%     idx_chosen: num, index of the sequence we want (1st, 2nd ... time     
%     that the sequence is performed in the recording).
%     sec_before_trigger: num, how many seconds before the triggers we want
%     to see to perform the t-test.
%     type_seq: num, ID of which type of sequence you using.
%     color: vector, RGB values. 
%
% Outputs
%     max_value: double, number of maximum histogram count, for plotting
%     purposes.

% Get the time between triggers
