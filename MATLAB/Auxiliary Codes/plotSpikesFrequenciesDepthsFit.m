function Sequence = plotSpikesFrequenciesDepthsFit(subject, subject_rec, direc, imec, sp, blockEvents, sec_before_trigger, Depth1, Depth2, idx_chosen)
%
% Function that plots the mean number of spikes after a trigger with a 
% specified frequency in the sequences Random, and Random Fifty among 10
% different depths (9 subdivision between Depth1 and Depth2).
%
% Done in the indicated depths separately and plotted the mean over all
% trials, highlighting the frequencies that are repeated more than num_big
% times.
%
% Inputs:
%     subject: num, subject ID.
%     subjec_rec: num, subject ID adding a 1 or 2 for Lateral or Dorsal
%     recordings.
%     direc: directory in which the files of the first recording (a) are 
%     located for that subject.
%     imec: num, 0 or 1: imec meaning the number of probe from which we are
%     looking at the data.
%     sp: struct, contains information about the spikes.
%     blockEvents: cell, where triggers are stored.
%     sec_before_trig: num, seconds to look and integrate before and after
%     trigger.
%     Depth1: int, from which depth you want to integrate the spikes.
%     Depth2: int, to which depth you want to integrate the spikes.
%     idx_chosen: num, index of the sequence we want (1st, 2nd ... time     
%     that the sequence is performed in the recording).
%
% Outputs:
%     Sequence: struct, contains information about the frequencies and the
%     spikes post trigger.
%     Fields:
%         data: struct, data from the acquisition.
%         frequencies: double, frequencies played, sorted from lower to
%         higher.
%         num_frequencies: double, how many times was each frequency
%         actually played.
%         post_trig: double, normalized number of spikes found after the trigger.
%         (Frequency, depth, type of sequence (1= Random fifty, 2=Random)).
%         data: double, frequencies presented.
%         goodness: struct, different metrics of how good is the Gaussian
%         fit to the data (excluding the most repeated frequencies).
%         goodness_with_high_freqs: struct, different metrics of how good
%         is the Gaussian fit to the data (including the most repeated
%         frequencies).
