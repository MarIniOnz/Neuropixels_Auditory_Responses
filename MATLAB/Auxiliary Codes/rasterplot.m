function rasterplot(spTimes, spSites, recParams, idx_chosen, cluster_chosen, type_seq)
%
% Function that represents a raster plot of the trials done in a sequence
% along with the 8 different trigger times.
%
% Inputs
%     spTimes: cell, with the vectors of the # trials containing the times 
%     of the spikes per trial. Should come from soi_trials.
%     spSites: cell, with the vectors of the # trials containing the ID's 
%     of the clusters to which the spikes belong. Should come from 
%     soi_trials.
%     recParams: struct, extracted from function recDataForSubject.
%     idx_chosen: num, which # of sequence in the block was chosen.
%     cluster_chosen: num, ID of the chosen cluster.
%     type_seq: num, ID of the sequence.
